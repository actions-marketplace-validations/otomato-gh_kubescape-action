    threshold: 20 
    # [‚öôÔ∏è Optional] 
    # A threshold value 0..100. This action will fail if, in terms of vulnerability points, your deployment scores more than the value specified.
    format: 'json' 
    # [‚öôÔ∏è Optional] 
    # An output's format: "pretty-printer", "json", "junit", "prometheus", "pdf" (default is "pretty-printer" (raw console dump)).
    cluster: ''
    # [‚öôÔ∏è Optional]
    # K8s cluster (kube-context) to run scan on (default is empty, so not set, and thus we're going to scan YAML files only).
```         
Scanning process itself is to be performed inside a docker container. For "json", "junit" and "pdf" this action provides report saving implemented as an uploaded artifact. This mean the report may be downloaded for consiquent analysis.
